<h2>NFL Quarterbacks Project</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to investigate correlations between some of the top ranked NFL quarterbacks of all time. Using a list of QB's aggregated from other list of rankings that are highly agreed upon and database containing information on every NFL player in history. From the data I was able to find correlations between the birthplace, round drafted, and the years played in the league of the best NFL QB's.</p>
