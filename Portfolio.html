<h2>NFL Quarterbacks Project</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to investigate correlations between some of the top ranked NFL quarterbacks of all time. Using a list of QB's aggregated from other list of rankings that are highly agreed upon and database containing information on every NFL player in history. From the data I was able to find correlations between the birthplace, round drafted, and the years played in the league of the best NFL QB's.</p>

<h2>City of Boulder Path Safety Project</h2>
<p>In conjunction with the City of Boulder, this project focused on the safety of multi use pass it in the city and public sentiments on the issue. Using interviews, surveys, and observations we were able to identify problematic stretches of path and the hazards they pose. We were then able to use the data in our findings and propose recommendations in order to increase safety for users.</p>

<h2>Domino's Internship</h2>
<p> While at Domino's for my internship I conducted a feasibility test with <a href="https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/">Neverwhere</a> virtual machines that could assist and approve Dominos technology development process. Build a website with the Django framework to allow Domino's chrome engineers to manage enterprise devices and carry out baseline functions quicker and more efficiently than they previously would on the google admin console. As well as created and implemented new Google license consumption report process. I achieved this by rewriting the query to access Dominos SQL database so that they no longer have to use a middleman host; decreasing the time and manpower it took to previously produced reports.</p>
